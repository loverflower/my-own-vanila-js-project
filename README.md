This App is internet store. You can see the order of stores (i get them from Rest API ) and order of products for each store (getting this data also from API using filtration on server side). You can edit fields of store's products and also delete chosen products. You can add new store, new products and delete current store.
I also added simple custom validation of fields (fields can't be empty, must have right type (name - string, price - number), and in case e-mail validation they must have special symbols).

Everything was built from scratch (besides API). You can see, that i spent lots of time building my own custom sorting and filtration without any third party library. This App has responsive structure.
